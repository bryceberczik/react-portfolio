      <p>
        Hello world! My name is Bryce Berczik, and I'm from Upland, California.
        I have always been fascinated by computers and technology. I’m currently
        learning both front-end and back-end development, aiming to pursue a
        career in software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been building PCs since I was 13, and over the years, my passion
        for tech has only grown. Aside from coding, I also have a creative side,
        I have a deep appreciation for food as an art form as I enjoy
        experimenting with flavors and presentations. At home, I have a pet cat
        named Tom who’s always keeping me company, while I develop and hone my
        skills as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m excited to see where this journey in tech takes me and how I can
        continue growing in this field.
